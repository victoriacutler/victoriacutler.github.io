And what's more, humans can also be very good at deceiving [Gladwell]. Does this mean, then, that we should be using AI to determine what we should do when it comes to the judgement and placement of people? Or, for that matter, for any decisions that may affect humanity?\nUnfortunately, there are countless examples in which AI algorithms create inequities. [facial recognition technology, policing].\n[but it is possible to make AI unbiases with datasheets for datasets and looking at raw data [raw data as an oxymoron] and it's important for models to not be a black box.
