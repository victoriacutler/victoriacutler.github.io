### about me

Hi üëãüèº I'm Victoria and I've recently graduated from the Bren School at UCSB with a Master's in Environmental Data Science. I'm passionate about environmental issues and I love to problem solve with code. In my free time I love to go camping/backpacking, attend game nights, and find new restaurants. Feel free to check out my portfolio, resume, or really whatever!
